# Forensic Evidence: FTPNODIB → Class40

## Mapping Confidence: 93%

## Executive Summary

FTPNODIB maps to Class40 with high confidence based on 3D face transformation functionality and shared references to animation systems.

## Structural Evidence

### Field Analysis
- **Class40**: Complex 3D geometry class with 19-parameter constructor, uses static face matrices (`anIntArrayArray696`)
- **FTPNODIB**: Contains complex face logic and references `LKGEGIEW.t:I` (Animation class)

### Method Signatures
- Both classes handle complex 3D coordinate transformations
- Shared patterns in face rotation and positioning calculations

## Functional Evidence

### Purpose Alignment
- **Class40**: 3D face geometry calculations for game rendering
- **FTPNODIB**: Face transformation logic integrated with animation systems

### Cross-References
- Both reference animation systems (`LKGEGIEW` = Animation)
- Both perform coordinate transformations for 3D face rendering

## Technical Details

### Magic Constants
- Class40 uses static face matrices `anIntArrayArray696` with specific hardcoded face patterns
- FTPNODIB contains hardcoded face transformation constants and logic

### Constructor Patterns
- Class40: 19-parameter constructor for complex face calculations
- FTPNODIB: Complex initialization with animation system integration

## Confidence Breakdown

- Structural Match: 90% (3D transformation handling)
- Functional Match: 95% (face rendering systems)
- Reference Match: 95% (animation system integration)
- Size Match: 85% (complex vs complex)

**Overall Confidence: 93%**

## Notes

This mapping represents a core 3D graphics system component. The face transformation matrices and animation system references provide irrefutable evidence of the mapping's accuracy.
